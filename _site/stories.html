                    <p>I had wanted to learn to code for a variety of reasons – you can use it to make cool things, it allows you to work from anywhere, you can use it to help people, it’s challenging, creative, relevant, and it can be very lucrative. But taking the leap into nerd-world was just so daunting. Where should I start? How long would it take me to understand all of that stuff? What if I didn’t enjoy it and the whole process was a complete waste of time? After 9 months of “doing the thing,” I’m finally at a place in my coding journey where I can actually answer those questions. This post is a recount of where I started, how I got to where I am today, and where I want to go in the future.</p>

                    <p>After doing some research and a lot of mental back and forth, in September I signed up for Portland Code School’s JavaScript Immersion class – which was 40-50 hours per week of mind-melting coding. It was incredibly difficult – mainly due to the fact that we learned SO MUCH over the course of only about 3 months. But nothing special ever happens within the comfort zone, and the end result was that I couldn’t have been happier with my decision. I had a great teacher, made some long-lasting friendships, became integrated into Portland’s tech community, learned A LOT, and got one step closer to discovering what it was that I wanted to do within the development field. </p>
